All API calls are formatted as follows:

The URL consists of server/router/action
The 'router' the name w/o the index prefix or extension (ie for 200.credentials.js it is credentials).
The 'action' is the method called on the router.

All parameters are passed in the body as a json object.

The response has the following format:

The reponse will have the following codes depending on the api result:
  * 202: success
  * 404: rejected
  * 500: exception

The status field in the body will mirror these codes.

The reponse body will have the following fields:
  * data:
  ** If success the return value of the function call
  ** If reject may contain a string value describing the reason or empty.
  ** If exceptoin will a string message describing the exception.
  * reqbody: the data passed to the request

Other fields may exist to assist in debugging but only the data field should be relied upon to retrieve results.
